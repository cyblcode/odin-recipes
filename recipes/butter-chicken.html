        <li>Cover the dish and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Line a strainer with cheesecloth and place yogurt to allow it to drain for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer drained yogurt to a medium bowl and mix the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, oil, garlic & ginger paste, melted butter, remaining 1 tablespoon of chili powder, and garam masala into yogurt until well combined.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F (200C)</li>
        <li>Place chicken on skewers; arrange in a 9x13 inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until almost cooked through for about 20 minutes.</li>
