    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>4½ cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup of butter, melted</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large boat. Let it be for 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture and mix in enough flour to make a soft yough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth for 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1 hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Puch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise for about 30 minutes until doubled in size</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place as many pieces of dough you can on the dough and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until puffy and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook for 2 to 4 minutes until browned. Remove from pan and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
    </ol>
